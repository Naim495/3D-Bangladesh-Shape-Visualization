# 3D-Bangladesh-Shape-Visualization
This project uses **GeoPandas**, **Shapely**, and **Matplotlib 3D** to visualize the shape of Bangladesh in 3D.


## 🚀 Features
- Loads Natural Earth dataset directly from the internet (no manual download needed)
- Extracts the geometry of Bangladesh
- Displays a simple 3D extruded shape of Bangladesh

Got it 👍
Here’s a **complete step-by-step English document** for **3D Bangladesh Shape Visualization with Python**.

# 📘 3D Bangladesh Shape Visualization – Step by Step Guide

## 🔹 Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Make sure you have these Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install geopandas matplotlib numpy shapely
```

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Download Bangladesh Shapefile

You need the Bangladesh boundary shapefile (`.shp`). You can download it from:

* [GADM](https://gadm.org/download_country.html)
* [GeoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/)

After downloading, you will have a file like: `bgd_adm0.shp` (Bangladesh boundary).

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Load Bangladesh Boundary

```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Load shapefile
bangladesh = gpd.read_file("bgd_adm0.shp")

print(bangladesh.head())
```

This will load the Bangladesh polygon boundary into memory.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Simple 2D Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot Bangladesh in 2D
bangladesh.plot(edgecolor="black", facecolor="lightgreen")
plt.title("Bangladesh 2D Shape")
plt.show()
```

👉 This step shows a **2D map** of Bangladesh.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Create 3D Visualization

```python
import numpy as np
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection

# Extract polygon geometry
poly = bangladesh.geometry.iloc[0]  # First polygon (Bangladesh outline)

# Extract coordinates
x, y = poly.exterior.xy
z = np.zeros_like(x)  # Z-axis = flat at 0

# Create 3D plot
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="3d")

# Add Bangladesh shape to 3D plot
verts = [list(zip(x, y, z))]
ax.add_collection3d(
    Poly3DCollection(verts, facecolors="lightgreen", edgecolors="black", linewidths=1, alpha=0.7)
)

# Labels and title
ax.set_xlabel("Longitude")
ax.set_ylabel("Latitude")
ax.set_zlabel("Height")
ax.set_title("3D Bangladesh Shape Visualization")

plt.show()
```

👉 Now you will see Bangladesh drawn in **3D**.

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Add Height (Optional Effect)

If you want the Bangladesh map to have some elevation (3D surface effect):

```python
# Example height function (sin wave for demo)
z = np.sin(x) * 5  

verts = [list(zip(x, y, z))]
ax.add_collection3d(
    Poly3DCollection(verts, facecolors="lightblue", edgecolors="black")
)
```

👉 This makes Bangladesh appear like a **3D mountain-style shape**.

---

# ✅ Final Notes

* You must download the Bangladesh shapefile before running this code.
* The code works with **matplotlib 3D** and **GeoPandas**.
* You can experiment by applying **real elevation data** instead of a sine wave for realistic terrain.
